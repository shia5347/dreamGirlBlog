	<center><p>A tour for what I am working on.</p></center>


	<center><p class="pBlog">Hello everyone, I am excited to share with you what I am currently working on: a top down pixelart adventure-puzzle game in which the main story is based upon talking to a girl inside a dream. The fictional character in question is the protagonist's love interest who doesn't exist in his real world. Similar to a "Waifu", the heroine is planned to become an anime or visual novel character inside the protagonist's world.</p></center>

	<h2 id="subHeading">My inspiration</h2>
	<center><p class="pBlog">One of my source of inspirations for the game is Yume2kki(A yume nikki fan game). To be honest, I found those games somewhat repetitive and stale at times and so wanted to create a more engaging gameplay with the same core element (exploring a dream world). This time, with a story and puzzles included rather than just walking around randomly and picking items hoping to not end up at the same place you were at before. I want to let the player explore beautiful places without them getting bored or frusturated.</p></center>


	<h2 id="subHeading">The art</h2>

	<center><p class="pBlog">Above you can see what the game is supposed to look like. There will be dialogue from the protagonist and some other characters. Above also you can see a mockup
		 I did of the protagonist's mother for the future dialogues between them. I am not entirely sure if I should add it. I'm worried it may make my game look less uniform. Maybe I should change the art style a little bit or entirely remove it in some places? I don't know yet. </p></center>

		<center><p class="pBlog">Here I have decided to use a storyboard template to try to figure out how my story will work within the game.</p></center>

	<h2 id="subHeading">Technical information</h2>

	<center><figcaption class="captionImage">A problem with the room collision.</figcaption>	

	<center><p class="pBlog">I don't think I was actually angry while scribbling on my screenshot; just frusturated and stressed. For the game I am using <a href="https://libsdl.org">SDL2</a> with C++. On my to do list I have room collisions to fix (so the player doesn't walk outside of them) and SAT collision to implement for the tilted walls. Once I am done that, then I have AABB to implement for the straight walls and objects and to make objects interactable. Then hopefully after all that, I can implement the good stuff such as dialogue and music.</p></center>



	<h2 id="subHeading">Conclusion</h2>
	<center><p class="pBlog">So that's it! I just have to add the basic parts such as SAT collision and then I can focus more on the game and story. I will be uploading new blog posts if I get the chance. Thank you for reading, to stay updated you can follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/Simple_gamesdev">twitter</a>. </p></center>
